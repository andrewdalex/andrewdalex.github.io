**I'll be applying to PhD programs in computer science this fall!**

## About Me
I'm an MS student at UC Santa Barbara advised by [Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/), but this fall 2023, I have had the opportunity to join [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html) Research as an intern in Boxborough, MA, where my work focuses on investigating the use of combinatorial optimization meta-heuristics in CPU microarchitectural design.
Previously, I earned a BS in Mathematics of Computation at UCLA.
I then spent 4 years as a software engineer at [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/) primarily working on large-scale distributed systems for low-latency location data processing in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) before deciding to pursue a career in computer science research.


My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of computer architecture and programming languages.
I have worked on projects which involve applying program synthesis to hardware design, and most recently, on a compiler which targets matrix multiplication accelerators from general-purpose code.
I presented my progress on this work at [PLArch '23](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/home/plarch-2023#program) in Orlando.


In my free time, I used to play a lot of rugby including a 4-year stint for the UCLA men's team.
I now stick to touch rugby, serve as an assistant coach for the UCSB rugby team, and play an occasional round of golf.
