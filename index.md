## About Me
I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington advised by [Gilbert Bernstein](http://www.gilbertbernstein.com/) in the [PLSE](https://uwplse.org/) group.
Previously, I earned an MS in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara advised by [Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/).
Even earlier, I earned a BS in Mathematics of Computation at UCLA and then spent 4 years as a software engineer at [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/) primarily working on large-scale distributed systems for low-latency location data processing in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) before deciding to pursue a career in computer science research.


My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of computer architecture and programming languages.
I have worked on projects which involve applying program synthesis to hardware design (to appear at ASPLOS '25), and on a compiler which targets matrix multiplication accelerators from general-purpose code as the topic of my MS thesis.
I presented my progress on this work at [PLArch '23](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/home/plarch-2023#program) in Orlando.


In my free time, I used to play a lot of rugby including a 4-year stint for the UCLA men's team.
I now stick to touch rugby and play an occasional round of golf.
