**I'll be applying to PhD programs in computer science this fall!**

## About Me
I'm an MS student at UC Santa Barbara advised by [Jonathan Balkind](https://jbalkind.github.io/), but interning with [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html) Research in Boxborough, MA fall of 2023 investigating the use of combinatorial optimization meta-heuristics in CPU microarchitectural design.
Previously, I earned a BS in Mathematics of Computation at UCLA.
I also spent 4 years as a software engineer at [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/) where I worked on large-scale distributed systems for low-latency location data processing in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) before deciding to pursue a career in computer science research.


My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of computer architecture and programming languages.
I have worked on projects which involve applying program synthesis to hardware design and most recently on a compiler which targets matrix multiplication accelerators from general-purpose code.
I presented my progress on this work at [PLArch '23](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/home/plarch-2023#program).


In my free time I used to play a lot of rugby, including for the UCLA men's team.
I now serve as an assistant coach for the UCSB rugby team and play golf and touch rugby.
